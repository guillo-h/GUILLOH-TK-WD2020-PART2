Part 2: JAVASCRIPT + API

Three column section and script added to Part 1, showing difference random and unique numbers every five seconds. Sometimes I had some issues connecting to the API but not the time to check the code properly. It is not the fanciest clean code but works, hope it is good enough ;)
